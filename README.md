# convoy-bench
convoy-bench contains all the code and scripts to benchmark any [convoy](https://github.com/frain-dev/convoy) cluster. The goal is to be able to quickly benchmark any Convoy cluster to know it's capacity. This was heavily inspired by [Clickbench](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/) and [Lavinmqperf](https://lavinmq.com/documentation/lavinmqperf)

## Why?
Webhook Gateways, similar to API Gateways, have become a critical component of modern web services. Teams are processing millions and billions of webhooks monthly. We created this benchmarking suite to easily enable our users to perform capacity planning to determine what cluster size they need for their workloads.

## Tools
1. k6.io 
2. Grafana
3. Ruby 3+
4. TimescaleDB

## Prequisites
1. Make sure you have a Convoy instance running and properly configured.
2. If you're going to be testing with a Message Broker, make sure you've provisioned the broker ahead as well. For each broker, there are specific parameters to set, read the flags to know what to supply.

## Usage
```bash
Usage:
  convoy-bench.rb exec -e, --endpoint-id=ENDPOINT-ID

Options:
  -p,   [--producer=PRODUCER]              # Select a producer to publish events from the following - http, sqs, pubsub or kafka.
                                           # Default: http
  -u,   [--uri=URI]                        # URI of your Convoy Cluster.
                                           # Default: http://localhost:5005
  -v,   [--vus=VUS]                        # Set how many virtual users should execute the test concurrently.
                                           # Default: 10
  -d,   [--duration=DURATION]              # Set how long the test should run. Use Golang string syntax: 1m, 5s, 10m5s .
                                           # Default: 1m
  -e,   --endpoint-id=ENDPOINT-ID          # ID of the endpoint configured on Convoy.
  -a,   [--api-key=API-KEY]                # Convoy Cluster API Key. Specify this if producer is http.
  -pid, [--project-id=PROJECT-ID]          # Convoy Cluster project ID. Specify this if producer is http.
  -q,   [--queue-url=QUEUE-URL]            # Amazon SQS URL. Specify this if producer is sqs.
  -aak, [--aws-access-key=AWS-ACCESS-KEY]  # AWS Access Key. Specify this if producer is sqs.
  -ask, [--aws-secret-key=AWS-SECRET-KEY]  # AWS Secret Key. Specify this if producer is sqs.

### Examples

#### HTTP/Incoming 
The example below will run for 10 concurrent users for 1 minute blasting events through Convoy's REST API.
```bash
./convoy-bench.rb exec -p http -u "{your-incoming-project-ingest-url}" -t incoming -v 10 -d 1m
```

#### HTTP/Outgoing Project 
The example below will run for 80 concurrent users for 1 minute blasting events through Convoy's REST API.
```bash
./convoy-bench.rb exec -p http -u "{your-convoy-instance-url}" -t outgoing -v 80 -d 1m --endpoint-id "{your-endpoint-id}" --project-id "{your-project-id}" --api-key "{your-api-key}"
```


The example below will run for 5 concurrent users for 5 minutes blasting events through an Amazon SQS Queue.
```bash
Â» ./convoy-bench.rb exec -p sqs -v 5 -d 5m \
--endpoint-id "{endpoint-id}" \
--queue-url "{queue-url}" \
--aws-access-key "{aws-access-key}" \
--aws-secret-key "{aws-secret-key}"
```
